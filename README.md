# cucumberTest

This repo is a technical assessment of web service endpoints for different int-test happy path scenarios.
The glu code has not been implemented yet. As a tester, the test scenarios would be added and the devs would write the glue code.

The following int-tests confirm the behavior of each endpoint works as intended:
Retrieving a list of users
Retrieving data using a user's id
Create a new user
Update data to an existing user
Delete an existing user
